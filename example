Let's say you wanted to to edit the wpa_supplicant.conf file located in /etc/wpa_supplicant/ but you can't. You don't have a usb keyboard or maybe you don't have a compatible monitor, likewise you can't access it via SSH, that's the whole reason you need to edit wpa_supplicant.conf, and, of course, all you have in the house is a Windows PC so you can't just mount the SD card and make the changes.

Enter rpi-conf.

1) Create a file called rpi-conf.cfg in the FAT32 partition (/boot) and add

> mode=r

to the file.  This will overwrite rpi-conf.cfg with /etc/rpi_conf/list and then shutdown the pi so you can safely remove the SD card

2) Modify rpi-conf.cfg and add

> wpa.conf, /etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant.conf

and add

> mode=w

on a line by itself some where in the file.

This will tell the program to look for a file called wpa.conf in the /boot FAT32 partition and that the config file it's associate with is located at /etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant.conf.  It doesn't actually what you name the file it will search for in /boot, but it does need to be followed by a comma and then the path to the file you want to edit.

3) Make sure to also add a file named wpa.conf in the /boot partition and add

> mode=r

to it so it will actually copy the file over

4) When you boot the pi it will create a backup of the current contents of /etc/rpi_conf_list (which can be restored by setting mode=b) and then copy the new contents of /boot/list to /etc/rpi_conf/list then reboot to put the new settings into affect

When reboot it will now know to examine wpa.conf in /boot and will copy the current wpa_supplicant.conf then shut down.

5) You can now edit wpa.conf on the FAT32 /boot parition using your Windows PC and when you are ready to impliment your changes add

> mode=r

to wpa.conf.

6) After a write operation, the mode will be changed from

> mode=r

to

> mode=u

This allows you to make any additional changes you want to before deleting the file.  Which can either be done manually or by setting

> mode=d

which will cause only the file on the /boot FAT32 partition to be deleted.

Config.py should not be modified as doing so could result in harm coming to the vital operating files in /boot
